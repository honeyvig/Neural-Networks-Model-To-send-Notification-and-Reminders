# Neural-Networks-Model-To-send-Notification-and-Reminders
Machine Learning Engineer for one or two initial consultancies to estimate feasibility of the project. The idea is to use neural networks for firing notifications/reminders in the personal development app. In case of positive perspective we plan to design an architecture of the future solution.

In our vision you are such an engineer if you:
- Have related past experience of designing, development and learning neural networks for different applications;
- Have a portfolio of multiple projects in this area;
- Know Python and other programming languages;
- Worked with such libraries as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas;
- Have hands on experience with at least some of such tools as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.

It would be ideal if:
- You have a higher education in math, know linear algebra, mathematical analysis and statistics;
- You have experience with machine learning in different areas and for different purposes (e.g. not only computer vision and not only natural language processing, but rather decision making, recommender systems, behavior analytics);
- You know Java (on which our current system is based) so that we could analyze and evaluate if it is worth using it for AI;
- You speak Russian as we speak Russian too so this will give us opportunity to better understand each other.
We hire people from both Russia and Ukraine.
===========================
Based on your project requirements, the goal is to develop a neural network model that can send notifications and reminders for a personal development app. Given that the initial phase involves consulting to evaluate the feasibility of the project, the approach will primarily focus on reviewing and assessing the following aspects:

    Problem Understanding: Identify the exact requirements for notifications and reminders. Is it based on time (schedule), user activity, goal progress, or behavior prediction?

    Data Collection and Preprocessing: Review the data sources and how they are structured. Are there patterns in user behavior that can be leveraged for reminders? What data is being collected for training the neural network?

    Model Choice: Evaluate whether neural networks (such as recurrent networks for sequence prediction or classification models for behavior prediction) are the best choice for this type of task.

    Tool Selection: Based on the existing system written in Java, assess whether integrating Python-based tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is feasible or if Java-based solutions are better.

Here’s a Python-based conceptual structure for this consultation:
1. Understand the Problem (Consultation Phase)

Before starting the development of the neural network model, you'll want to assess the data types, notification triggers, and user behaviors. Here's a basic Python code structure to load and explore potential datasets to understand user behavior for notification-based reminders.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming you have a dataset of user activities or behaviors
# Example: A dataset of user actions in the app (time, activity, progress, etc.)
data = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')

# Display a summary of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Check for missing data
print(data.isnull().sum())

# If there is a column for user actions or activities
# Visualizing activity patterns
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
data['activity'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('User Activity Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Activity Type')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# For time-based notifications, check time distribution
data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(data['timestamp'])
data['hour'] = data['timestamp'].dt.hour

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
data['hour'].value_counts().sort_index().plot(kind='line')
plt.title('User Activity by Hour of Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour')
plt.ylabel('Number of Activities')
plt.show()

2. Evaluate Neural Network Approach for Notifications

Given the nature of the task (sending reminders/notifications based on user activity), a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a long short-term memory (LSTM) model might be suitable for time-series or sequence-based prediction. Here's a basic model using Keras (which is built on top of TensorFlow) for this task.

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import numpy as np

# Example preprocessing steps for time-series data
# Assuming data['activity'] is a sequence of user actions and you want to predict the next step
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))

# Reshape your data to a 3D array [samples, time steps, features]
# Assuming 'activity' is a numerical sequence (e.g., encoding of behavior or progress)
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data['activity'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Prepare data for LSTM
def create_dataset(data, time_step=1):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_step):
        X.append(data[i:(i + time_step), 0])
        y.append(data[i + time_step, 0])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

time_step = 10  # For example, predicting next activity based on last 10 time steps
X, y = create_dataset(data_scaled, time_step)

# Reshape input to be 3D [samples, time steps, features]
X = X.reshape(X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)

# Build a basic LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Output layer to predict the next step

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Prediction (for sending reminders)
predictions = model.predict(X)

3. Integration with Current System (Java)

Since the system is Java-based, it’s important to assess how Python-based models will integrate with the existing Java infrastructure. Some potential ways to do this:

    Python-Java Integration: Use a tool like Py4J or Jython to call Python functions from Java. Alternatively, expose the Python model as a web service (using Flask or FastAPI) and have Java call the API.
    Evaluate Java-based ML Tools: If Python integration is not viable, you could explore Java-based tools such as Weka, Deeplearning4j, or MOA.

4. Initial Consultation on Architecture and Feasibility

Here’s how the consultation can be structured:

    Step 1: Review user data and understand the required behaviors and notification triggers.
    Step 2: Evaluate feasibility of using neural networks (like LSTM) for predicting reminders.
    Step 3: Discuss how the neural network model can be integrated into the existing Java-based system.
    Step 4: Assess the necessary infrastructure (cloud-based services or on-premise servers) for scaling the solution.

5. Final Architecture Discussion (for Future Development)

If the initial consultation leads to a positive perspective, the next steps involve designing the architecture for the final solution, which may include:

    Data Flow Design: How user data flows from the app to the model and how notifications are triggered.
    Model Serving: Using TensorFlow Serving or FastAPI to deploy the model as a service.
    Scalability: Ensuring the solution can handle the expected user base.
    Monitoring: Implementing monitoring tools for model performance and user engagement.

Qualifications for a Consultant:

For the consultancy role, the ideal candidate should:

    Have experience designing and deploying machine learning models, particularly for recommendation or decision-making systems.
    Have knowledge of integration strategies between Python and Java, ensuring that neural networks can be deployed and used in the existing ecosystem.
    Be familiar with tools like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch and have a background in analyzing and designing algorithms for user behavior prediction.

Final Steps:

    Portfolio Review: Review examples of past projects in machine learning, especially for applications like user behavior prediction, recommendation systems, or decision-making models.
    Feasibility Analysis: Analyze the current system and datasets to assess the feasibility of implementing an AI-powered notification system.
    Consultation Outcome: Provide a roadmap for building the neural network model, integrating it with the Java system, and preparing for future development milestones.

This approach provides a roadmap for the feasibility consultation, and sets the stage for a more detailed architecture design if the project proceeds.
